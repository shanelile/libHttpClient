/// An async_queue_t contains async work.  When you make an async call, that call is placed
/// on an async queue for execution.  An async queue has two sides:  a worker side and
/// a completion side.  Each side can have different rules for how queued calls
/// are dispatched.
///
/// You don't have to create an async queue to make async calls.  If no queue is passed
/// the call will use a default queue. Work on the default queue will be invoked on
/// the system thread pool. Completions will be invoked on the thread that initiated
/// the async call when that thread is alertable.
